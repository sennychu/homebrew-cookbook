# The Homebrew Cookbook

*The missing manual for the missing package manager.*

This project exists as additional documentation for using Homebrew and
creating new Formulae.

It could *probably* be part of the official Wiki, or a manpage, etc.,
but is being developed here as it represents my own views of what makes
a good, merge-ready Formula.
